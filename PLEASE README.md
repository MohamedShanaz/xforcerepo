We have completed the project specified according to the final project document and some more because 
we had time after submission of the final document.
We had made graph mockups and decided the logic to create Integration and graphing
We have developed the application to generate graph for trigononmetric formula 
But we have been unable to complete the Integration graphing of formula.
For Generating Trigonometric formula graph representation we used a Base class call 'qcustomplot'
And we added a new class call 'newgraph' having files related to graph.
